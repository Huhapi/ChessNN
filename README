First version of my chess intelligence program. 
It uses pytorch neural networking to play predictive chess moves.
To run this program:
Poetry is required.
this should all be done in a terminal in *\chessNeuralNetwork\ChessNN
pip install poetry     #make sure to mark the path, as it will be needed to add to global or referenced to use poetry.
poetry install --with dev,docs,test,build        
*chessNeuralNetwork\ChessNN\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 # use total path in terminal to activate the pyproject.
python src/play_chess.py  # This should launch the pygame chess to play against the neural network.

The challenging part of this project is understanding how the neural network(nn) is working,
connecting the pipeline, and assembling the data in such a way(tensor) that it is useful for the nn.
The next step is to add in dual processing to increase the playing strength of the nn.

Thanks for checking out the first version of my chess engine!
